## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Why Use It?

You can publish a link to your blog the moment you find something worth sharing using the Raindrop.io browser extension. It‚Äôs a fast, natural way to save and post what you‚Äôre reading.

This also lets you post links to a dedicated section of your blog‚Äîwithout cluttering your main posts. With [Ghost.org](https://Ghost.org) adding ActivityPub support, you‚Äôll soon be able to automatically syndicate these posts to the fediverse and other social platforms‚Äîwhile keeping full ownership of your content and avoiding the need to repost manually.

You can use this feature to:
- Share quotes with commentary  
- Build a public reading list  
- Leave breadcrumbs from your research  
- Start lightweight posts that are part blog, part bookmark
- Seamlessly distribute link posts to the fediverse

---
## Example Workflow

1. Save a page using the Raindrop extension in your browser (desktop or mobile).<br>
   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/201f25ce-7077-41c6-b12c-8169c4ac2525" style="width:45%;">

2. Highlight a passage and add a note using the Raindrop extension.<br>
   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fbddcd4-690f-4243-8257-8aced9fd26b9" style="width:45%;">

3. Automatically publish to your Ghost blog.<br>

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic Publishing**: Syncs the most recent Raindrop bookmark with a custom tag of your choice to your Ghost blog.
- **Update Detection**: If the bookmark was already synced, the corresponding Ghost post will be updated (not duplicated).
- **Clean Formatting**: Notes and highlights are wrapped in semantic HTML and stored in a Ghost HTML card block.
  - Paragraphs, line breaks, and bullet lists (`-` or `*`) are preserved.
  - Inline code (`` `like this` ``) and fenced code blocks (```lang) are rendered using proper HTML code tags.
  - Safe HTML tags like `<b>`, `<i>`, and `<a href="...">` are allowed and sanitized.
- **YouTube Embeds**: Bookmarks that link to YouTube automatically include an embedded video player above your note.
- **Metadata Embedded**: Posts include embedded metadata (like Raindrop ID and tags) for filtering or custom display logic.
- **RSS Feed Friendly**: Works well with Ghost‚Äôs RSS system to support custom feeds using the `links` tag.

---
### üßæ Content Formatting

When you add notes or highlights to a Raindrop bookmark, this function converts them into readable, structured HTML for Ghost.

Supported features:

- **Paragraphs**: Line breaks are preserved between paragraphs.
- **Bullet Lists**: Lines starting with `-` or `*` are turned into `<ul><li>` HTML lists.
- **Inline Code**: Wrap text in backticks like `` `code` `` to render it as `<code>code</code>`.
- **Code Blocks**: Fenced code blocks using triple backticks (```) are supported and optionally language-tagged:


Entering:

````markdown
```js
console.log("Hello");
```
````

Becomes:

```js
console.log("Hello");
```

* **Safe HTML**: Simple tags like `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<em>`, and `<a href="...">` are preserved and sanitized for safe rendering in Ghost.

* **Highlight + Note Pairing**: Highlights from Raindrop are rendered inside `<blockquote>` elements. Notes attached to highlights are displayed beneath them with full formatting.

---

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielraffel/raindrop-to-ghost-sync.git
cd raindrop-to-ghost-sync
```


---

### 3. Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```


---

### 4. Set Environment Variables

You‚Äôll need to define the following variables when deploying:

| Variable             | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RAINDROP_API_KEY`   | Your Raindrop test token                                                    |
| `GHOST_API_URL`      | Your Ghost blog URL (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com`)                         |
| `GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY`| Your Ghost Admin API key (`<id>:<secret>`)                                  |
| `SYNC_SECRET`        | A token you‚Äôll use in the `Authorization` header to trigger syncs securely  |


---

### 5. Deploy to Google Cloud Functions
```
gcloud functions deploy raindropToGhostSync \
  --gen2 \
  --runtime nodejs20 \
  --trigger-http \
  --region YOUR_REGION \
  --entry-point raindropToGhostSync \
  --set-env-vars RAINDROP_API_KEY=YOUR_RAINDROP_KEY,GHOST_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com,GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY=YOUR_ADMIN_KEY,SYNC_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
```

üìå Replace:
-	YOUR_REGION with a region like us-central1
-	RAINDROP_API_KEY with your Raindrop test token
- GHOST_API_URL with your Ghost Admin API key
- GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY with your YOUR_ADMIN_KEY
-	SYNC_SECRET with your token

When prompted:
```
Allow unauthenticated invocations of new function [raindropToGhostSync]? (y/N)? y
```


---

### üß™ Testing the Function

Trigger the sync manually with curl using your SYNC_SECRET:
```
curl -X POST https://REGION-PROJECT.cloudfunctions.net/raindropToGhostSync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET"
```
To verify your Raindrop bookmarks are being tagged using YOUR_RAINDROP_API_KEY:
```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_RAINDROP_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.raindrop.io/rest/v1/raindrops/0?tag=1"
```


---

### üîÅ Updating the Function

If you make changes to index.js, re-deploy using YOUR_REGION:
```
gcloud functions deploy raindropToGhostSync \
  --gen2 \
  --runtime nodejs20 \
  --trigger-http \
  --region YOUR_REGION \
  --entry-point raindropToGhostSync
```
‚úÖ You do not need to re-set environment variables unless they change.

---

### ‚è∞ Automate with Google Cloud Scheduler

To run your Raindrop ‚Üí Ghost sync automatically every minute, use Google Cloud Scheduler to call your function on a recurring schedule.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Grant Invoke Permissions

Cloud Scheduler needs permission to call your Cloud Function. Run:
```
gcloud functions add-iam-policy-binding raindropToGhostSync \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --member="serviceAccount:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL" \
  --role="roles/cloudfunctions.invoker"
```
Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL with the service account Scheduler will use.

To find that email:

In most cases, the default is:
```
PROJECT_ID@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
```
You can confirm this in the IAM section of the Cloud Console or by running:
```
gcloud iam service-accounts list
```

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: Create the Scheduler Job

Once the correct service account has access, create the job (update this with your region, your cloud function URI, and your SYNC_SECRET :

```
gcloud scheduler jobs create http raindrop-ghost-sync \
  --location=us-central1 \
  --schedule="* * * * *" \
  --uri=https://us-central1-YOUR_PROJECT.cloudfunctions.net/raindropToGhostSync \
  --http-method=POST \
  --headers="Authorization=Bearer ${SYNC_SECRET}" \
  --attempt-deadline=540s
```
üîê This sends your pre-defined SYNC_SECRET as a bearer token in the Authorization header. Your Cloud Function should reject requests that don‚Äôt include this.

---

### üß™ Manual Test (Optional)

You can test the sync manually by running:
```
gcloud scheduler jobs run raindrop-ghost-sync --location=us-central1
```
Check your function logs to confirm it was triggered successfully:
```
gcloud functions logs read raindropToGhostSync --region=us-central1 --limit=10
```

Changed something in your Raindrop bookmark and don‚Äôt want to wait for an automated update? Trigger a sync manually with curl using your SYNC_SECRET:
```
curl -X POST https://REGION-PROJECT.cloudfunctions.net/raindropToGhostSync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET"
```
Or make it even easier‚Äîadd a shortcut to your terminal by including this in your ~/.zshrc:
```
alias pushlink='curl -X POST https://REGION-PROJECT.cloudfunctions.net/raindropToGhostSync -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET"'
```
Then just type `pushlink` in your terminal whenever you want to instantly sync a new link.

---

### üîß How to Create a Custom Tag in index.js 

By default, the function looks for the most recent bookmark tagged with 1. You can change this by editing the tag filter in getLatestRaindropBookmark():
```
params: {
  tag: '1', // ‚Üê change this to your preferred tag (e.g. 'publish', 'linkroll')
  sort: '-created',
  perpage: 10
}
```
You can also adjust:
-	How the post content is formatted (inside formatGhostContent)
-	The logic for filtering out empty bookmarks (via shouldProcessBookmark)
-	Any HTML structure or metadata formatting as needed

---

## üìå To Do

- Add deletion support: Remove Ghost posts if the corresponding Raindrop no longer has the custom tag
  - Strategy: Retrieve all links-tagged Ghost posts ‚Üí extract raindrop-id from each ‚Üí query Raindrop API ‚Üí if tag is missing, delete the post
  - Consider adding a simple database or caching layer to avoid redundant API calls
- Add support for a `.env` file
